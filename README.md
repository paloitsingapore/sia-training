# Step 2 - Introduction to Task Management Rule in Copilot
We can use Copilot's custom instructions to guide it to perform tasks in a specific way, achieving better results.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Update Copilot instruction
```path
.vscode/settings.json
```

## Try advance prompts to create complex application
