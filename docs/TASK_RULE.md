 # Task Guidelines

## Guidelines for Task Creation
- create task file under docs/TASK_PLAN.md
- Create tasks as one-line descriptions (task titles)
- Break down complex tasks into subtasks using numeric hierarchy (e.g., 2.1, 2.2, 2.3)
- Tasks must be in logical implementation order
- Keep tasks and subtasks small and manageable
- Maximum one task in progress at a time
- Always ask clarification questions before starting to implement any task
- Do not make any changes until all clarification questions are answered

## Guideline for Task Status Tracking:
- Use â¬œ for TODO
- Use ðŸŸ¨ for IN PROGRESS
- Use âœ… for DONE
- Parent task status must reflect its subtasks:
  - â¬œ if all subtasks are TODO
  - ðŸŸ¨ if any subtask is IN PROGRESS or mix of DONE and TODO
  - âœ… only if all subtasks are DONE

## Guideline for Task Completion
- Verify your changes once done before completing a task in any markdown file
- List the changes that you made after completing a task
- Task status workflow must follow these steps:
  1. Mark task as IN PROGRESS (ðŸŸ¨) when starting implementation
  2. Implement the changes
  3. List all changes made
  4. Ask explicitly for user review and acknowledgment
  5. Only mark as DONE (âœ…) after receiving clear "approved" or "accepted" response
  6. Never mark as DONE automatically after implementation

## Guideline for Task Execution
- Always go one task at a time 
- Always ask clarification questions before starting the next task
- Do not proceed with any changes until questions are answered
- Strictly implement only what is specified in the task - no additional features or modifications outside the task scope
- Any changes beyond task scope must be logged as new tasks for future implementation

## Task Format Example

      2.2.2. Add bcrypt hashing function ðŸŸ¨
      2.2.3. Create password validation helper â¬œ
   2.3. Implement JWT token generation â¬œ
      2.3.1. Set up JWT secret key â¬œ
      2.3.2. Create token generation service â¬œ
3. Set up database schema â¬œ
