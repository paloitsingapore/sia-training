# Task Guidelines

## Guidelines for Task Creation
- Create tasks as one-line descriptions (task titles)
- Break down complex tasks into subtasks using numeric hierarchy (e.g., 2.1, 2.2, 2.3)
- Maximum task depth is two levels (e.g., 1.1, 1.2, but not 1.1.1)
- Tasks must be in logical implementation order
- Keep tasks and subtasks small and manageable
- Maximum one task in progress at a time
- Always ask clarification questions before starting to implement any task
- Do not make any changes until all clarification questions are answered

## Guideline for Task Status Tracking:
- Use â¬œ for TODO
- Use ðŸŸ¨ for IN PROGRESS
- Use âœ… for DONE
- Parent task status must reflect its subtasks:
  - â¬œ if all subtasks are TODO
  - ðŸŸ¨ if any subtask is IN PROGRESS or mix of DONE and TODO
  - âœ… only if all subtasks are DONE

## Guideline for Task Completion
- Verify your changes once done before completing a task in any markdown file
- List the changes that you made after completing a task
- Task status workflow must follow these steps:
  1. Mark task as IN PROGRESS (ðŸŸ¨) when starting implementation
  2. Implement the changes
  3. List all changes made
  4. Ask explicitly for user review and acknowledgment
  5. Only mark as DONE (âœ…) after receiving clear "approved" or "accepted" response
  6. Update relevant documentation:
     - New features/endpoints: Add to both documentation files as needed
     - Document any new types, models, or endpoints
  7. After marking as DONE, propose a conventional commit message
  8. Never mark as DONE automatically after implementation

## Conventional Commit Guidelines
- After marking a task as DONE (âœ…), always provide a commit message following this format:
  - Format: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`
  - Types:
    - feat: New feature
    - fix: Bug fix
    - docs: Documentation changes
    - style: Code style changes
    - refactor: Code refactoring
    - test: Adding tests
    - chore: Maintenance tasks
  - Scope: Affected component (optional)
  - Description: Short summary in present tense
  - Example: `feat(auth): add password hashing implementation`

## Guideline for Task Execution
- If the request is to create a story, follow STORIES_IA_RULES.md guidelines and do not implement
- Always go one task at a time 
- Always ask clarification questions before starting the next task
- Do not proceed with any changes until questions are answered
- Strictly implement only what is specified in the task - no additional features or modifications outside the task scope
- Any changes beyond task scope must be logged as new tasks for future implementation

## Example Task Structure
â¬œ 1. Implement user authentication system
   âœ… 1.1. Design database schema for users
   ðŸŸ¨ 1.2. Implement user registration endpoint with validation and hashing
   â¬œ 1.3. Implement email verification service
   â¬œ 1.4. Implement user login endpoint with JWT
   â¬œ 1.5. Add refresh token mechanism

Note: This example demonstrates proper task hierarchy with two-level depth, status tracking, and breakdown of a complex feature into manageable subtasks.
